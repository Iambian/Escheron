Cure or Blink.

item and Detox spell, which cure Poison status. Adjusted some prices of items.

MAGIC: The Faze enemy skill is now a spell that player characters can learn.
Slight increase to Blizzard / Freeze's damage (and cost) to incentivize it
over other elemental spells, as there are few enemies weak to ice.

Reorganized spell sorting so Blizzard / Freeze goes after Thunder / Storm, for
consistency with how spells tend to be sorted by least-to-greatest power, and
the fact that the status menu lists lightning before ice. (This also looks
more consistent with FF1's spell level sorting, I guess?)
