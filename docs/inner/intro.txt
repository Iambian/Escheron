Before the time of man, there was the age of gods.

Unable to agree upon the fate of man, the gods warred for centuries, culminating in their own destruction.

In the gods' demise, their immortal strength separated from their heavenly bodies and remained suspended just beyond the reach of man.

Learning of this, many insufferable men fought to claim the power of the gods for themselves.

Like the gods, mankind too was quickly approaching mutual annihilation.

Then a coven of mages calling themselves the Arcanians built a great tower.

At the summit of this tower the Arcanians erected a seal, barring any mortal from setting foot in the heavens.

The conflict ceased for a time.

Centuries later, the Kingdom of Asnoth has grown suspicious of the citizens of Ragnoth, the direct descendents of the Arcanians.

Fearing Ragnoth might use its ancient knowledge to subdue other kingdoms, Asnoth's leader declared that the descendants of the Arcanians - and the knowledge they guarded - be destroyed.

It would seem that history must once again repeat itself...
